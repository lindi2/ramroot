build: configuration file?

build: automate fetching sources for binaries on image

build: make size of flash image configurable

doc: document use of special uuid space

?: log boot time to /etc/ramroot, benchmark different options

build: add more tests

?: make it possible to access shell if cp takes a long time on bootup

ramroot-admin CMD
ramroot-snapshot PREV NUM DESC
ramroot-update-grub DEFAULT FALLBACK FALLBACK-TIMEOUT


failsafe scenarios
------------------

1) user does apt-get dist-upgrade that upgrades glibc
2) user is aware of potential trouble and tells ramroot "save state as
snapshot 8 and boot it. If I don't ssh within 10 minutes reboot
snapshot 7".

1) user starts to configure things
2) power outage hits
3) unsaved changes are lost but system boots from latest saved snapshot

1) user changes firewall settings
2) user notices he has locked himself out!

1) user makes a small change
2) user saves state as snapshot 8
3) user thinks the change is small and doesn't want to reboot
4) power outage hits 30 days later
5) systems reboots but snapshot 8 is not bootable!


1) upgrade glibc
2) ramroot-snapshot 7 8 'glibc upgrade'
3) ramroot-update-grub --default 8 --failsafe 7 --failsafe-timeout 10
4) reboot
5) ramroot-stop-watchdog
6) ramroot-update-grub --default 8
